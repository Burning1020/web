# A Very Meaningful and Interesting Meetup with openEuler Community

On May 31, we hosted a meetup with the openEuler community, inviting the wasmEdge community and the QuarkSoft project together. We first discussed the underlying container isolation technology, wasmEdge and Quark, which are both sandbox technology, and then we discussed the low-level container runtime Kuasar and the high-level container runtime iSulad. I hope you like it.

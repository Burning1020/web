role: An Efficient Multi-Sandbox Container Runtime

superuser: true
---

<br/>
Kuasar is an efficient container runtime that provides cloud-native, all-scenario container solutions by supporting multiple sandbox techniques. Written in Rust, it offers a standard sandbox abstraction based on the sandbox API. Additionally, Kuasar provides an optimized framework to accelerate container startup and reduce unnecessary overheads.
Kuasar is licensed under Apache 2.0. and free for personal or commercial use absolutely. We welcome contributors!

In the current state of development, no single underlying container technology can support all cloud-native scenario requirements well. Our goal is to provide a better way to manage and balance enterprises' requirements for container isolation, security, general, speed, and resource consumption.
